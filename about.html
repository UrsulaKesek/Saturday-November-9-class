    <h1>Things you need to know about Cats</h1>
    <p>
      Cats are believed to be the only mammals who don't taste sweetness. Cats
      are nearsighted, but their peripheral vision and night vision are much
      better than that of humans. Cats are supposed to have 18 toes (five toes
      on each front paw; four toes on each back paw). Cats can jump up to six
      times their length.
