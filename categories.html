      What kind of cats will you find in South America?
    </h1>
    <p>
      Felis pardalis. Distribution: From Argentina to Arizona Habitat: Forest
      and scrubland. Size: Body Length: 65-69cm Tail Length: 27-40cm Weight:
      11-16kg Lifespan: 17 years in captivity. Food: Agoutis, hares, mice,
      monkeys and birds. Sexual Maturity: 6-8 months Mating: Once or twice a
      year. Gestation: 70 days. Litter size: 2-4 kittens Territory: Ocelots live
      in forests and scrubland. They are extremely well camouflaged. In a forest
      habitat the coat is golden in colour, whereas in scrubland, it has a
      greyish tinge to its fur. Ocelots spend time resting in trees, and climb
      down them backwards. Most are solitary, and mark their territory by
      spraying trees with urine. Pairs, however, are not unknown. Daily life:
      The ocelot relies on its hearing and eyesight to detect prey when hunting
      at night. Prey animals include agoutis, hares, monkeys, birds and mice,
      but an ocelot will eat anything it can kill. All hunting is done on the
      ground, with the ocelot stalking its prey until it gets very close, then
      pouncing and catching it with its sharp claws. A quick bite to the neck is
      then enough to kill the victim. Small prey is eaten head-first, but if the
      prey is too big, the ocelot will start with a soft part of the body.
      Breeding: Ocelots may breed up to twice a year, in summer and winter.
      Females call loudly to attract a male when they are in season. During
      mating, the male grasps the female by the back of the neck until after
      mating is complete. After mating the female attacks the male, but then
      invites him to mate again. Pregnancy lasts just over two months, and the
      two to four young are born in a hidden nest. Kittens are fully furred, but
      blind and helpless at birth. They feed only on their mother's milk for the
      first two weeks, and she eats their droppings to keep the nest clean. As
      they get older, the mother brings them live prey to teach them how to
      kill. When they become competent hunters, they will either leave the
      mother of their own accord, or be driven away by her. Ocelots have been
      hunted extensively for their pelts but they are now fully protected from
      hunting under international law.</p>
